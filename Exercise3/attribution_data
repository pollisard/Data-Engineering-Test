For the Attribution historical data issue we should follow the following steps:

1. Export latest data: Implement daily exports from the BigQuery database to Google Cloud.
   Set it up so it only takes new data missing from last execution.
3. Data archiving: Set up a data archiving process that runs daily after the export to store
   the exported data in a long-term storage solution.
4. Define data retention policy: Determine how long we need to retain the historical data
   based on business requirements.
